            <h2 class="text-primary">Key Benefits</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Adaptive learning platforms cater to individual needs, ensuring employees progress at their own pace (Intellinez, 2025).</li>
                <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Gamified learning and virtual simulations make training more interactive and enjoyable (Why Digital Learning Programs Hold the Key for Organizations to Bridge Workforce Skills Gaps, 2021).</li>
                <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Studies show a 30% improvement in knowledge retention with VR and gamification (Oxford Medical Simulation, 2023).</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> E-learning platforms allow organizations to train large groups of employees efficiently (Hanson, 2025).</li>
                <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Reduces the need for physical training sessions and associated logistical expenses (The Impact of Technology on Employee Training and Development, 2023).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Potential Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>
                While technology-driven training offers numerous benefits, it also comes with potential drawbacks. Initial costs for implementing advanced technologies like VR and AI can be high. Additionally, technical challenges such as software glitches, connectivity issues, and compatibility problems can disrupt the learning process (Overcome These Common Challenges When Implementing a New Learning Technology, 2023).
